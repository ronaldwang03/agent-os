## 📝 Presentation Templates

### 5-Minute Lightning Talk

```
SLIDE 1: The Problem
- AI agents are powerful but unpredictable
- Prompt-based safety asks the LLM to follow rules
- The LLM decides whether to comply

SLIDE 2: The Solution
- Agent OS: Kernel-based enforcement
- Intercepts actions BEFORE execution
- Policy engine decides, not the LLM
- 0% policy violation guarantee

SLIDE 3: Demo
- [Show finance-soc2 or healthcare-hipaa example]
- Transaction blocked by policy
- Audit trail generated
- Compliance report ready

SLIDE 4: Standards Compliance
- Finance: SOC2, FDC3, FINOS CDM
- Healthcare: HIPAA, HL7 FHIR, SMART
- Cloud: SPIFFE, Kubernetes, CNCF

SLIDE 5: Get Started
- pip install agent-os-kernel
- github.com/imran-siddique/agent-os
- Questions?
```
