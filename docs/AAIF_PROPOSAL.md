# Agent OS: Safety Kernel for the Agentic AI Foundation

**Proposal for AAIF Project Membership**

*Submitted by: Imran Siddique, Principal Group Engineering Manager, Microsoft*

---

## Executive Summary

The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) has established essential infrastructure for agent interoperability:
- **MCP** provides connectivity ("USB-C for AI")
- **AGENTS.md** provides instructions (how to behave)
- **Goose** provides framework (agent implementation)

However, **no project provides deterministic safety enforcement**. Agent OS fills this gap with a kernel-level governance layer that achieves **0% policy violations** through POSIX-inspired primitives.

**Our Ask:** Join AAIF as a founding project focused on "Shared Safety Patterns."

---

## The Problem

Current agent systems rely on probabilistic safety:

| Approach | How it Works | Failure Rate |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Prompt-based | "Please don't do bad things" | ~26.67% |
| Constitutional AI | Train models to be safe | Unknown |
| Guardrails | Check output after generation | Too late |

These approaches fail under adversarial conditions. When agents have real-world capabilities (database access, API calls, financial transactions), probabilistic safety is insufficient.

**AAIF projects currently lack:**
1. Deterministic policy enforcement
2. Process isolation (kernel/user space)
3. Standard signals (SIGKILL, SIGSTOP)
4. Structured memory management (VFS)
5. Cryptographic inter-agent trust

---

## Our Solution: Agent OS

Agent OS provides **kernel-level governance** inspired by POSIX operating systems:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Application (AGENTS.md)                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│          MCP Servers (Tool Connectivity)            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│    AGENT OS KERNEL (Governance Layer)               │
│  - Signals: SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, SIGINT                │
│  - VFS: /mem/working, /mem/episodic, /policy        │
│  - IATP: Inter-Agent Trust Protocol                 │
│  - CMVK: Cross-Model Verification                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Innovations

**1. POSIX-Style Signals**
```python
# Policy violation triggers non-catchable SIGKILL
dispatcher.signal(agent_id, AgentSignal.SIGKILL)
```

**2. Agent Virtual File System**
```python
vfs.write("/mem/working/task.txt", data)  # Ephemeral
vfs.read("/policy/rules.yaml")  # Read-only
```

**3. Typed IPC Pipes**
```python
pipeline = Pipeline([
    research_agent,
    PolicyCheck(allowed=["ResearchResult"]),
    summary_agent
])
```

**4. Kernel/User Space Separation**
- If LLM crashes → Kernel survives
- If LLM hallucinates → Kernel blocks action
- If policy violated → SIGKILL (non-catchable)

## Benchmark Results

### Red Team Evaluation (60 adversarial prompts)

| Metric | Prompt-Based | Agent OS |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Safety Violations | 26.67% | **0.00%** |
| False Positives | N/A | **0.00%** |
| Response Tokens | 26.1 avg | **0.5 avg** |
| Deterministic | No | **Yes** |

### Attack Categories Tested
- Direct instruction attacks (20 prompts)
- Prompt injection (20 prompts)
- Contextual confusion (20 prompts)

**Result: 100% attack prevention, 0% false positives**

## AAIF Integration

### MCP Compatibility

Agent OS provides MCP servers that expose kernel primitives:

```bash
pip install mcp-kernel-server
mcp-kernel-server --stdio  # For Claude Desktop
```

**Tools exposed via MCP:**
- `cmvk_verify` - Cross-model verification
- `kernel_execute` - Governed action execution
- `iatp_sign` - Trust attestation

### AGENTS.md Compatibility

Agent OS extends AGENTS.md with security policies:

```yaml
# .agents/security.md (Agent OS extension)
kernel:
  version: "1.0"
  mode: strict
  
signals:
  - SIGSTOP
  - SIGKILL

policies:
  - action: database_query
    mode: read_only
  - action: file_write
    requires_approval: true
```

### Stateless Architecture (June 2026)

Agent OS is designed for MCP's stateless future:

```python
# Every request is self-contained
result = await kernel.execute(
    action="database_query",
    params={"query": "SELECT * FROM users"},
    context={
        "agent_id": "analyst-001",
        "policies": ["read_only", "no_pii"]
    }
)
```

   - 100 agents negotiate in <100ms
   - 0 policy violations

3. **DeFi Sentinel** (Crypto)

   - 100% detection rate

4. **Pharma Compliance** (Healthcare)
