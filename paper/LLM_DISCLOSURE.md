# LLM/AI Assistance Disclosure

This document discloses the use of AI assistants in the development of Context-as-a-Service and its associated paper.

## Overview

In accordance with emerging academic standards and transparency requirements, we document all significant uses of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI assistants in this project.

## AI Tools Used

### GitHub Copilot
- **Purpose**: Code completion, boilerplate generation
- **Scope**: Implementation of utility functions, test scaffolding
- **Human oversight**: All generated code reviewed and modified

### Claude (Anthropic)
- **Purpose**: Documentation drafting, code review, architectural discussions
- **Scope**: README sections, docstrings, design brainstorming
- **Human oversight**: All outputs reviewed, edited, and validated

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- **Purpose**: Literature review assistance, writing feedback
- **Scope**: Finding related work, phrasing suggestions
- **Human oversight**: All references independently verified

## Specific Contributions

### Code
| Component | AI Assistance Level | Human Contribution |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Core algorithms | Low | Algorithm design, implementation |
| Test cases | Medium | Test strategy, validation |
| Documentation | Medium | Structure, technical accuracy |
| Examples | Low | Use case design, verification |

### Paper
| Section | AI Assistance Level | Human Contribution |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Abstract | Medium | Core ideas, final editing |
| Introduction | Medium | Problem framing, claims |
| Related Work | Low | Paper selection, analysis |
| Method | Low | All technical content |
| Experiments | None | Design, execution, analysis |
| Results | Low | Interpretation, presentation |

## Verification Steps

1. **Code correctness**: All AI-generated code tested with comprehensive test suite
2. **Factual accuracy**: All claims verified against primary sources
3. **Citation integrity**: All references manually checked
4. **Originality**: Core ideas and contributions are human-originated

## Statement

> The intellectual contributions, experimental design, and key insights in this work originate from the human authors. AI tools were used as productivity aids for implementation and documentation, similar to how one might use an IDE's autocomplete or a grammar checker. All AI outputs were critically reviewed and substantially modified by human authors.

## Compliance

This disclosure is prepared in accordance with:
- NeurIPS 2024+ AI disclosure requirements
- ACL 2024+ responsible AI guidelines  
- General principles of academic integrity
