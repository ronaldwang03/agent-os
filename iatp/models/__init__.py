"""
Core data models for the Inter-Agent Trust Protocol (IATP).

This module defines the Pydantic models used for capability manifests,
trust negotiation, and policy enforcement. These models form the
foundation of the IATP protocol.

Classes:
    TrustLevel: Enumeration of agent trust levels.
    ReversibilityLevel: Enumeration of transaction reversibility support.
    RetentionPolicy: Enumeration of data retention policies.
    PrivacyContract: Privacy and data handling policies.
    AgentCapabilities: Capabilities advertised by an agent.
    CapabilityManifest: The complete manifest exchanged during handshake.
    QuarantineSession: Session info for quarantined requests.
    TracingContext: Distributed tracing context.

Example:
    Creating a capability manifest::

        from iatp.models import (
            CapabilityManifest,
            AgentCapabilities,
            PrivacyContract,
            TrustLevel,
            ReversibilityLevel,
            RetentionPolicy,
        )

        manifest = CapabilityManifest(
            agent_id="my-agent",
            trust_level=TrustLevel.TRUSTED,
            capabilities=AgentCapabilities(
                reversibility=ReversibilityLevel.FULL,
                idempotency=True,
            ),
            privacy_contract=PrivacyContract(
                retention=RetentionPolicy.EPHEMERAL,
            ),
        )

        print(f"Trust Score: {manifest.calculate_trust_score()}/10")

        Calculate a trust score (0-10) based on capabilities and privacy.
        
        The trust score helps clients make informed decisions about agent reliability.
        Higher scores indicate more trustworthy agents with better security practices.
        
        Scoring Criteria:
        ----------------
        Base Score: 5 (neutral)
        
        Trust Level Adjustments:
        - VERIFIED_PARTNER: +3 (well-known, vetted partner)
        - TRUSTED: +2 (established trust relationship)
        - STANDARD: 0 (no prior relationship)
        - UNKNOWN: -2 (minimal information)
        - UNTRUSTED: -5 (known issues or red flags)
        
        Capability Bonuses:
        - Idempotency support: +1 (safe retry behavior)
        - Reversibility (full or partial): +1 (can undo actions)
        
        Privacy Adjustments:
        - Ephemeral retention: +2 (best privacy, data deleted after session)
        - Permanent/forever retention: -2 (worst privacy, data kept indefinitely)
        - No human review: +1 (automated processing only)
        
        Score Ranges:
        - 8-10: Highly trustworthy (verified partners with strong privacy)
        - 5-7: Moderately trustworthy (standard agents with decent practices)
        - 3-4: Low trust (some concerns, user should be cautious)
        - 0-2: Very low trust (significant concerns, strong warnings needed)
