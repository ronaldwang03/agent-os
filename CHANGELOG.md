## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added

### Features
- **Trust Levels**: verified_partner, trusted, standard, unknown, untrusted
- **Reversibility**: full, partial, none
- **Retention Policies**: ephemeral, temporary, permanent
- **Policy Enforcement**:
  - Trust score >= 7: Allow immediately
  - Trust score 3-6: Warn (requires override)
  - Trust score < 3: Warn (requires override)
  - Credit card + permanent retention: Block (403)
  - SSN + non-ephemeral retention: Block (403)
