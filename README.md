## The Problem

Traditional context extraction systems require manual configuration and suffer from FIVE major fallacies:

### 1. The "Flat Chunk Fallacy" (Structure Problem)
- **Flat Chunk Approach**: Treating all content equally (e.g., splitting every 500 words and embedding)
- Manual weight adjustments for different sections
- Static rules that don't adapt to content
- No learning from document patterns
- Poor optimization for different document types
- **The Reality**: A class definition has different value than a TODO comment, but flat approaches treat them the same

### 2. The "Context Amnesia" Problem (Metadata Problem)
- **Isolated Chunks**: Chunks lose their context when separated from parent documents
- Example: "It increased by 5%." - What increased? Nobody knows.
- **The Reality**: A chunk without metadata is meaningless. Without knowing it's from "Q3 Earnings > Revenue > North America", the AI can't understand what increased.

### 3. The "Time-Blind Retrieval" Problem (Temporal Problem)
- **The Naive Approach**: "Relevance = Vector Similarity"
- **The Reality**: In software, truth is a moving target
- Example: "How to reset the server" in 2021 ≠ 2025
- If AI retrieves the 2021 answer because wording matches better, it fails
- **The Problem**: Traditional systems don't consider when information was created

### 4. The "Flat Context Fallacy" (Priority Problem)
- **The Naive Approach**: "Stuff everything into the Context Window until it's full"
- **The Reality**: Not all context is created equal
- Current conversation ≠ User preferences ≠ Historical archives
- No clear prioritization between what's happening NOW vs. what happened LAST YEAR
- **The Problem**: Traditional systems treat all context with the same priority

### 5. The "Official Truth Fallacy" (Source Problem)
- **The Naive Approach**: "The Official Documentation is the source of truth"
- **The Reality**: Official docs are often theoretical; Slack logs contain the actual fix
- Example: Docs say "API limit is 100" but team knows "it crashes after 50"
- Traditional AI only shows official answer (misleading)
- **The Problem**: No distinction between official theory and practical reality

## The Solution

Context-as-a-Service provides a fully automated pipeline:

1. **Ingest** raw data (PDF, Code, HTML)
2. **Auto-Detect** the structure (e.g., "This looks like a Legal Contract")
3. **Auto-Tune** the weights (e.g., "Boost the 'Definitions' section by 2x")
4. **Apply Time Decay** (e.g., "Recent content ranks higher than old content")
5. **Track Sources** (e.g., "This is from Slack vs official docs")
6. **Detect Conflicts** (e.g., "Official says X, team says Y")
7. **Serve** the perfect context via API with transparent citations

**No manual tuning required** - the service analyzes your corpus and tunes itself.

## How Auto-Tuning Works

The system automatically optimizes context weights through multiple strategies:

### 1. Structure-Aware Indexing (Solving the "Flat Chunk Fallacy")

The system implements **hierarchical structure-aware indexing** that assigns content to three tiers based on importance:

#### **Tier 1 - High Value Content (2.0x base weight)**
- Titles and Headers (H1, H2)
- Class Definitions and Interfaces
- API Contracts and Endpoint Definitions
- Main abstracts and conclusions
- Critical sections (Definitions, Authentication, Authorization)

#### **Tier 2 - Medium Value Content (1.0x base weight)**
- Body text and paragraphs
- Function logic and implementations
- Method descriptions
- Standard documentation sections

#### **Tier 3 - Low Value Content (0.5x base weight)**
- Comments and inline documentation
- Footnotes and disclaimers
- TODO/FIXME markers
- Acknowledgments and copyright notices

**Why This Matters:**
Traditional "flat chunk" approaches treat all content equally, assuming a random paragraph on page 50 has the same value as critical API definitions. Our structure-aware approach ensures that when you search for information, a `public class Authentication` definition will rank higher than a `// TODO: fix this later` comment, even if they have similar semantic similarity to your query.

**Example:**
```python
# Both sections mention "authentication" with similar frequency
# But they get vastly different weights:

Section: "Authentication API Contract"     # Tier 1
Weight: 5.0x  (boosted as High Value)

Section: "// TODO: improve authentication" # Tier 3  
Weight: 0.5x  (demoted as Low Value)
```

### 2. Metadata Injection (Solving "Context Amnesia")

The system **enriches every chunk** with its parent metadata to maintain context:

#### **The Problem:**
```
Original Chunk: "It increased by 5%."
AI Response: "What increased? I don't know."
```

The chunk has lost its parents. It has **context amnesia**.

#### **The Solution:**
```
Enriched Chunk: "[Document: Q3 Earnings] [Chapter: Revenue] [Section: North America] It increased by 5%."
AI Response: "North America revenue increased by 5% in Q3."
```

Now the vector **carries the weight of its context**. When the AI retrieves it, it knows exactly what increased.

#### **How It Works:**

1. **Hierarchy Tracking**: The system tracks document hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3 → H4)
2. **Metadata Injection**: When extracting context, metadata is prepended to each chunk
3. **Smart Formatting**: Metadata includes: Document Title, Document Type, Chapter, Section
4. **Toggleable**: Can be enabled/disabled per request

**Example Transformation:**

```python
# HTML Document Structure
<h1>Q3 2024 Financial Results</h1>
<h2>Revenue Analysis</h2>
<h3>North America</h3>
<p>Revenue in North America increased by 5%.</p>

# Without Metadata Injection:
"Revenue in North America increased by 5%."

# With Metadata Injection:
"[Document: Q3 Earnings Report] [Type: Research Paper] [Chapter: Q3 2024 Financial Results] [Section: North America] Revenue in North America increased by 5%."
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Context Preservation**: Chunks never lose their origin
- ✅ **Better AI Responses**: AI can understand what each chunk refers to
- ✅ **Improved Search**: Metadata becomes part of searchable content
- ✅ **Hierarchical Understanding**: Maintains document structure in vectors

### 3. Time-Based Decay (Solving "Time-Blind Retrieval")

The system implements **"The Half-Life of Truth"** - mathematical gravity that pulls old data down.

#### **The Problem:**
```
Naive Approach: "Relevance = Vector Similarity"

The Reality: In software, the truth is a moving target.
- "How to reset the server" in 2021 ≠ 2025
- If AI retrieves 2021 answer (better word match), it fails
```

#### **The Solution:**
```
Formula: Score = Similarity × (1 / (1 + days_elapsed))

Result: A document from Yesterday with 80% match 
        beats a document from Last Year with 95% match.
```

**We believe in the Decay Function:**
- We don't "cut off" old data (history is useful for debugging)
- We apply mathematical "Gravity" that pulls old data down
- We prioritize "What happened latest" over "What matched best"
- In a living system: **Recency IS Relevance**

**Example:**

```python
# Recent document (Yesterday)
Base Similarity:  80%
Decay Factor:     0.500  (1 / (1 + 1 day))
Final Score:      0.400  (0.80 × 0.500)

# Old document (Last Year)
Base Similarity:  95%
Decay Factor:     0.003  (1 / (1 + 365 days))
Final Score:      0.003  (0.95 × 0.003)

Winner: Recent document (0.400 > 0.003) ✅
```

**Decay Curve:**
- **Day 0 (Today)**: Factor = 1.0 (no decay)
- **Day 1 (Yesterday)**: Factor = 0.5 (50% weight)
- **Day 7 (Week ago)**: Factor = 0.125 (12.5% weight)
- **Day 30 (Month ago)**: Factor = 0.032 (3.2% weight)
- **Day 365 (Year ago)**: Factor = 0.003 (0.3% weight)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Temporal Relevance**: Recent content automatically ranks higher
- ✅ **No History Loss**: Old documents remain searchable, just deprioritized
- ✅ **Living Documentation**: System adapts as documentation evolves
- ✅ **Configurable**: Decay rate can be adjusted (faster/slower decay)

**Configuration:**
```python
# Enable/disable time decay in search
results = store.search(
    "server reset",
    enable_time_decay=True,  # Default: True
    decay_rate=1.0           # Default: 1.0 (higher = faster decay)
)

# Configure for context extraction
extractor = ContextExtractor(
    store,
    enable_time_decay=True,  # Default: True
    decay_rate=1.0           # Default: 1.0
)
```

**Why This Matters:**
Traditional RAG systems treat a 3-year-old document the same as yesterday's update. Our time decay ensures that when you ask "How do I deploy?", you get the current process, not the legacy one that happened to have better keyword matches.

### 4. Context Triad (Solving "Flat Context Fallacy")

The system implements **intimacy-based context layers** that treat context by relevance, not just speed.

#### **The Naive Approach:**
```
"Stuff everything into the Context Window until it's full."
```

#### **The Engineering Reality:**
We need to treat context like a tiered storage system, but defined by **Intimacy**, not just speed.

#### **L1: Hot Context (The Situation)**
**Definition:** What is happening right now?

**Examples:**
- Current conversation messages
- Open VS Code tabs
- Error logs streaming in real-time
- Active debugging session

**Policy:** "Attention Head" - Overrides everything
- Highest priority, always included
- Auto-maintained (limited to 50 most recent items)

#### **L2: Warm Context (The Persona)**
**Definition:** Who am I?

**Examples:**
- LinkedIn profile
- Medium articles
- Coding style preferences
- Favorite libraries and frameworks
- Communication style

**Policy:** "Always On Filter" - Colors how AI speaks to you
- Persistent across sessions
- Should be part of system prompt
- Doesn't need retrieval every time

#### **L3: Cold Context (The Archive)**
**Definition:** What happened last year?

**Examples:**
- Old tickets from previous years
- Closed pull requests
- Historical design documents
- Legacy system documentation

**Policy:** "On Demand Only" - Fetch only when explicitly asked
- **Never** automatically included
- Requires explicit query to access
- Prevents historical data from polluting hot window

#### **Usage Example:**

```python
from caas.triad import ContextTriadManager

manager = ContextTriadManager()

# Add hot context (current situation)
manager.add_hot_context(
    "User debugging: NullPointerException at line 145",
    metadata={"source": "error_log"},
    priority=3.0
)

# Add warm context (user persona)
manager.add_warm_context(
    "Senior Python developer, prefers type hints",
    metadata={"category": "Profile"},
    priority=2.0
)

# Add cold context (historical archive)
manager.add_cold_context(
    "Ticket #1234: Fixed similar bug in 2023",
    metadata={"date": "2023-06-15"},
    priority=1.0
)

# Get context (Hot + Warm by default, Cold excluded)
result = manager.get_full_context(
    include_hot=True,
    include_warm=True,
    include_cold=False  # Cold requires explicit query
)

# Access cold context with explicit query
result = manager.get_full_context(
    include_cold=True,
    cold_query="NullPointerException"  # Required for cold context
)
```

**Why This Matters:**
Traditional systems treat current errors the same as year-old tickets. The Context Triad ensures the right context is available at the right time with the right priority. Current situation (hot) always takes precedence, user persona (warm) is always on, and historical data (cold) never pollutes the working context unless explicitly requested.

**See [CONTEXT_TRIAD.md](CONTEXT_TRIAD.md) for detailed documentation.**

### 5. Pragmatic Truth (Solving "Official Truth Fallacy")

The system implements **transparent source tracking** that distinguishes between official documentation and practical reality.

#### **The Naive Approach:**
```
"The Official Documentation is the source of truth."
```

#### **The Engineering Reality:**
We need to present BOTH official answers and practical experience with full transparency.

#### **Example: API Rate Limits**

**Official Documentation says:**
> "The API supports 100 requests per minute."
> Source: [Official Docs] API Documentation v2.1 (2023-07-08)

**Team Experience shows:**
> "Actually, the API crashes after 50 requests. We've hit this multiple times."
> Source: [Team Chat] Slack #engineering (2024-01-02)

**AI Response:**
> "Officially, the docs say the limit is 100. However, looking at recent team discussions and production logs, the real limit appears to be 50 before instability occurs."

#### **Source Types:**
- `OFFICIAL_DOCS` - Official documentation, specs
- `TEAM_CHAT` - Slack, Teams conversations
- `PRACTICAL_LOGS` - Server logs, error logs
- `RUNBOOK` - Operational runbooks
- `TICKET_SYSTEM` - Jira, GitHub issues
- `CODE_COMMENTS` - Inline code comments
- `WIKI` - Internal wikis
- `MEETING_NOTES` - Meeting decisions

#### **Features:**
1. **Source Detection** - Automatically identifies source types
2. **Citation Tracking** - Every section cites its source with timestamp
3. **Conflict Detection** - Identifies when official and practical sources disagree
4. **Transparent Responses** - Shows both perspectives with recommendations
5. **Time Priority** - Recent practical experience weighs more than old docs

#### **Usage Example:**

```python
from caas.storage import ContextExtractor

extractor = ContextExtractor(
    store,
    enable_citations=True,      # Include source citations
    detect_conflicts=True,      # Detect conflicts between sources
    enable_time_decay=True      # Prioritize recent information
)

context, metadata = extractor.extract_context(
    document_id="doc-123",
    query="server restart",
    max_tokens=2000
)

# Check citations
print(f"Sources: {len(metadata['citations'])}")

# Check conflicts
if metadata['conflicts']:
    print("⚠️ Conflict detected between official and practical sources!")
```

**Why This Matters:**
Traditional RAG systems treat all sources equally, leading to misleading responses when official documentation is outdated. Our Pragmatic Truth approach ensures users get the real answer with full transparency about sources and conflicts. When a 2-day-old Slack conversation contradicts 6-month-old docs, the AI shows both and recommends the practical approach.

**See [PRAGMATIC_TRUTH.md](PRAGMATIC_TRUTH.md) for detailed documentation.**

### 6. Document Type Detection

The service analyzes content to detect document types:
- **Legal Contracts**: Looks for "whereas", "party", "hereby", "indemnify"
- **Technical Docs**: Identifies "API", "configuration", "parameters"
- **Research Papers**: Detects "abstract", "methodology", "results"
- **Source Code**: Recognizes programming patterns

### 7. Base Weight Assignment

Each document type has optimized base weights:

```python
Legal Contract:
  - Definitions: 2.0x
  - Terms: 1.8x
  - Termination: 1.5x

Technical Documentation:
  - API Reference: 1.8x
  - Examples: 1.7x
  - Parameters: 1.6x
```

### 8. Content-Based Adjustments

Weights are further adjusted based on:
- **Code Examples**: +20% weight
- **Definitions**: +30% weight  
- **Important Markers**: +15% (words like "critical", "must", "required")
- **Length**: +10% for substantial sections (>500 chars)
- **Position**: +15% for first section, +10% for last

### 9. Query Boosting

When a query is provided, sections matching the query get +50% weight boost.

### 10. Corpus Learning

The system analyzes patterns across all documents to:
- Identify common section structures
- Calculate average optimal weights
- Provide optimization suggestions

**Auto-Tuning**: Classes (1.6x), Main functions (1.8x), APIs (1.7x)  
**Result**: Code context highlighting important implementations

## Configuration

The service works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults. No configuration required!

### Metadata Enrichment

Metadata enrichment is **enabled by default**. To disable it:

```python
from caas.storage import ContextExtractor, DocumentStore

store = DocumentStore()
# Disable metadata enrichment
extractor = ContextExtractor(store, enrich_metadata=False)
```

### Time-Based Decay

Time-based decay is **enabled by default** and can be configured:

```python
from caas.storage import ContextExtractor, DocumentStore

store = DocumentStore()

# Configure decay for context extraction
extractor = ContextExtractor(
    store, 
    enable_time_decay=True,  # Enable/disable (default: True)
    decay_rate=1.0           # Adjust decay speed (default: 1.0)
)

# Configure decay for search
results = store.search(
    "your query",
    enable_time_decay=True,  # Enable/disable (default: True)
    decay_rate=1.0           # Adjust decay speed (default: 1.0)
)
```

**Decay Rate Guide:**
- `decay_rate=0.1`: Slow decay (yesterday = 0.91x, week = 0.59x)
- `decay_rate=1.0`: Standard decay (yesterday = 0.5x, week = 0.125x) ← **Default**
- `decay_rate=2.0`: Fast decay (yesterday = 0.33x, week = 0.067x)

### Custom Tuning Rules

For custom tuning rules, modify `caas/tuning/tuner.py`:

```python
TYPE_SPECIFIC_WEIGHTS = {
    DocumentType.LEGAL_CONTRACT: {
        "definitions": 2.0,  # Adjust as needed
        "terms": 1.8,
        ...
    }
}
```
