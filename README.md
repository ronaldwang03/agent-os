**An immutable, append-only ledger for agent experiences. Part of the Agent OS ecosystem.**

## Why emk?

Agents that cannot remember their past repeat the same mistakes. Traditional databases let you update or delete records—this is dangerous for agent memory. What if a bug overwrites critical learning? What if you need to audit agent decisions?

We built `emk` to **subtract the problem of mutable memory.** Instead of complex database transactions and state management, we provide a single abstraction: the immutable Episode. Once written, never changed. This constraint eliminates entire classes of bugs and enables reliable agent learning systems.

**Scale by Subtraction:** By removing the ability to modify history, we remove the need for complex versioning, rollback logic, and concurrency controls. The result is a memory system that scales reliably.

## Installation

```bash
pip install emk
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
from emk import Episode, FileAdapter

store = FileAdapter("agent_memory.jsonl")
episode = Episode(goal="Query user data", action="SELECT * FROM users", 
                  result="200 rows", reflection="Query was fast")
store.store(episode)
```

That's it. Five lines. Your agent's experience is now permanently recorded.

## Architecture

`emk` sits at **Layer 1 (Primitives)** of the Agent OS stack. It provides the foundational storage abstraction that higher layers depend on:

- **Layer 1 (Primitives):** `emk` stores raw episodes. `caas` (Context-as-a-Service) reads from `emk` to build working memory. `cmvk` (Cryptographic Message Verification Kernel) may sign episodes for audit trails.
- **Layer 2 (Infrastructure):** `amb` (Agent Message Bus) transports messages. `iatp` (Inter-Agent Trust Protocol) verifies trust. These layers may log their own episodes into `emk`.
- **Layer 3 (Framework):** `agent-control-plane` orchestrates agents. `scak` (Self-Correction and Alignment Kernel) uses `emk` to learn from mistakes.

`emk` has **zero** dependencies on other Agent OS components. It is the foundation, not the application.

## The Ecosystem Map

`emk` is one component of the modular Agent OS. Here's how the pieces fit together:

| Layer              | Component                  | Purpose                                   | Repository                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Primitives**     | `caas`                     | Context-as-a-Service (Working Memory)     | [caas](https://github.com/imran-siddique/caas)  |
| **Primitives**     | `cmvk`                     | Cryptographic Verification Kernel         | [cmvk](https://github.com/imran-siddique/cmvk)  |
| **Primitives**     | `emk`                      | Episodic Memory Kernel                    | [emk](https://github.com/imran-siddique/emk)    |
| **Infrastructure** | `iatp`                     | Inter-Agent Trust Protocol                | [iatp](https://github.com/imran-siddique/iatp)  |
| **Infrastructure** | `amb`                      | Agent Message Bus                         | [amb](https://github.com/imran-siddique/amb)    |
| **Infrastructure** | `atr`                      | Agent Tool Registry                       | [atr](https://github.com/imran-siddique/atr)    |
| **Framework**      | `agent-control-plane`      | Agent Orchestration and Control           | [agent-control-plane](https://github.com/imran-siddique/agent-control-plane) |
| **Framework**      | `scak`                     | Self-Correction and Alignment Kernel      | [scak](https://github.com/imran-siddique/scak)  |

Each component is independently useful. Together, they form a complete Agent Operating System.
