# Design Review Agent

> Merges document structure analysis with deep architecture review to provide actionable feedback before peer design reviews.

## 🎯 Vision

**Shift-left design quality** — Catch structural and architectural issues *before* the design review meeting, so discussions focus on strategic decisions rather than surface-level gaps.

### Current State: Merging Two Prototypes

| Prototype | Focus | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Structure Analyzer** | Document completeness, sections, formatting | ✅ Prototype complete |
| **Architecture Reviewer** | Deep analysis inside Word docs — key design issues, how to address them | ✅ Prototype complete |
| **Merged Agent** | Combined capabilities | 🔄 In progress |

### Value Differentiator

> *"Why not just use Researcher?"*

| Capability | Researcher | Design Review Agent |
|------------|------------|--------------------|
| General Q&A on design topics | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Team-specific design patterns** | ❌ | ✅ Learns from your team's past reviews |
| **Historical precedent lookup** | ❌ | ✅ "We solved this in Project X" |
| **Security baseline enforcement** | ❌ | ✅ Applies org security rules |
| **Continuous learning loop** | ❌ | ✅ Improves from each review |
| **Pre-meeting preparation** | ❌ | ✅ Structured checklist for reviewers |

### Roadmap
- ✅ Prototype 1: Document structure analysis
- ✅ Prototype 2: Architecture issue detection
- 🔄 Merge prototypes into unified agent
- 🔜 Learning loop from live design discussions
- 🔜 Pilot with Learn, Localization, Startups teams
- 🔜 Broader rollout based on feedback

### Human Checkpoints
> Points where human approval is required before proceeding.

- [ ] Before filing blocking issues
- [ ] Before recommending architectural changes

### Failure Modes
> Known ways this agent can fail.

- Out-of-context recommendations
- Overly generic guidance
- Missed historical precedent

## Workflow Integration

### Trigger Scenarios
> When to invoke this agent.

- Draft design doc ready for pre-review
- Before scheduling design review meeting
- When seeking historical precedent for a pattern
