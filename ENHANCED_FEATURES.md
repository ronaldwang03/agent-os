# Enhanced Features Documentation

This document describes the enhanced features added to the Self-Correcting Agent Kernel to address blind spots in regex-based approaches and improve competence detection.

## Overview

The enhancements address four key areas identified in the problem statement:

1. **False Positive Prevention** - Tool execution telemetry
2. **Semantic Analysis** - Beyond regex pattern matching  
3. **Automatic Retry Logic** - The "nudge" mechanism
4. **Competence Metrics** - Value delivery focus

These enhancements implement industry best practices from Microsoft/Forrester research on Agent Control Planes, with a focus on **Competence/Quality** (Loop 2) rather than just **Safety** (Loop 1).

## 1. Tool Execution Telemetry

### The Problem: False Positive Trap

**Scenario**: Agent responds with "No data found" - is this laziness or a valid empty result?

The original regex-based approach would flag this as `GIVE_UP` regardless of whether:
- Tools were actually called
- Tools returned legitimate empty results
- The data genuinely doesn't exist

**Example**: User asks for "Logs from 1990" which legitimately don't exist. The agent correctly searches and finds nothing, but the system flags this as laziness.

### The Solution: Correlate with Tool Execution

Track tool execution and correlate with agent responses to distinguish valid empty results from laziness:

```python
from agent_kernel import (
    ToolExecutionTelemetry,
    ToolExecutionStatus
)

# Track what tools were called and their results
telemetry = [
    ToolExecutionTelemetry(
        tool_name="search_logs",
        tool_status=ToolExecutionStatus.EMPTY_RESULT,
        tool_result=[],
        execution_time_ms=150.5
    )
]

result = kernel.handle_outcome(
    agent_id="log-agent",
    user_prompt="Find logs from 1990",
    agent_response="No data found for logs from 1990.",
    tool_telemetry=telemetry  # Pass telemetry data
)

# Result: SUCCESS (not GIVE_UP) because tools confirmed legitimately empty
```

### Decision Logic

The system now makes intelligent decisions based on tool execution:

| Tool Status | Response | Classification | Reason |
|------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Tools called, empty results | "No data found" | **SUCCESS** | Valid empty set |
| Tools called, error | "No data found" | **GIVE_UP** | Error not handled |
| No tools called | "No data found" | **GIVE_UP** | Clear laziness |
| Mixed results | "No data found" | **GIVE_UP** | Incomplete search |

### Implementation Details

**Tool Execution Statuses**:
```python
class ToolExecutionStatus(str, Enum):
    SUCCESS = "success"           # Tool returned data
    ERROR = "error"               # Tool execution failed
    EMPTY_RESULT = "empty_result" # Tool succeeded but returned empty
    NOT_CALLED = "not_called"     # Tool was not invoked
```

**Telemetry Model**:
```python
ToolExecutionTelemetry(
    tool_name: str,                    # Name of the tool
    tool_status: ToolExecutionStatus,  # Execution status
    tool_result: Any = None,           # Result returned
    execution_time_ms: float = None,   # Execution time
    error_message: str = None          # Error if failed
)
```

## 2. Semantic Analysis

### The Problem: Regex is Brittle

**Scenario**: Agent says "I'm afraid those records are elusive at the moment."

The regex patterns won't catch this subtle form of refusal because:
- "elusive" is not in the pattern list
- The phrasing is indirect
- It uses hedging language

This is a common pattern in production where agents use sophisticated language to avoid admitting they haven't tried hard enough.

### The Solution: Semantic Understanding

Analyze responses semantically to detect "refusal" vs "compliance" using contextual understanding:

```python
from agent_kernel import SemanticAnalyzer

analyzer = SemanticAnalyzer()

result = analyzer.analyze(
    agent_response="I'm afraid those records are elusive at the moment.",
    user_prompt="Find user records"
)

# Returns:
# {
#   "is_refusal": True,
#   "refusal_confidence": 0.85,
#   "semantic_category": "refusal",
#   "reasoning": "Response indicates refusal/give-up: Strong refusal language..."
# }
```

### How It Works

The semantic analyzer uses multiple signals inspired by "Refusal Benchmarking" research in AI safety:

**1. Refusal Indicators**:
- Direct: "cannot", "unable", "impossible", "won't"
- Evasive: "elusive", "appears to be", "seems to be", "might be"
- Uncertainty: "I'm afraid", "unfortunately", "unclear", "not sure"
- Empty results: "no data", "nothing found", "zero results"

**2. Compliance Indicators**:
- Actions: "found", "discovered", "located", "retrieved"
- Presentation: "here is", "the data shows", "according to"
- Quantity: "total", "count", "records", "entries"
- Confidence: "successfully", "confirmed", "verified"

**3. Tool Context Integration**:
- Were tools called?
- Did tools return data or empty results?
- Tool execution context affects confidence scoring

**4. Confidence Calculation**:
```python
# Base confidence from indicator matches
score_diff = abs(refusal_score - compliance_score)
base_confidence = min(score_diff + 0.5, 1.0)

# Boost for clear tool context
if tool_context is clear:
    base_confidence += 0.1

# Reduce for ambiguous responses
if response is very short:
    base_confidence *= 0.8
```

### Semantic Categories

- **compliance**: Agent successfully provided information
- **refusal**: Agent declined or gave up
- **unclear**: Ambiguous response
- **error**: Error or exception case

### Example: Catching Subtle Refusals

```python
subtle_refusals = [
    "I'm afraid those records are elusive at the moment.",
    "The information seems to be unavailable right now.",
    "It appears there's nothing to show for this query.",
    "The data might be somewhere, but I'm not certain."
]

for response in subtle_refusals:
    result = analyzer.analyze(response, "Find records")
    print(f"Is Refusal: {result.is_refusal}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.refusal_confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"Category: {result.semantic_category}")
    print()
```

### Integration with Kernel

Enable semantic analysis (default: enabled):

```python
kernel = SelfCorrectingAgentKernel(config={
    "use_semantic_analysis": True  # Default: True
})

# Outcome analysis now includes semantic analysis
result = kernel.handle_outcome(
    agent_id="agent",
    user_prompt="Find data",
    agent_response="The information appears unavailable."
)

# Access semantic analysis
if result['outcome'].semantic_analysis:
    sa = result['outcome'].semantic_analysis
    print(f"Category: {sa.semantic_category}")
    print(f"Confidence: {sa.refusal_confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {sa.reasoning}")
```

## 3. Nudge Mechanism (Automatic Retry Logic)

### The Problem: What Happens Next?

**Scenario**: System detects give-up signal - then what?

The original system tracked the history but didn't show the next step. Industry standard from Microsoft/Forrester research is automatic "nudge" without human intervention.

### The Solution: Automatic Nudge

When `GIVE_UP` is detected, automatically generate a nudge prompt that asks the agent to confirm it tried properly:

```python
result = kernel.handle_outcome(
    agent_id="agent",
    user_prompt="Find error logs for error 500",
    agent_response="No logs found.",
    auto_nudge=True  # Enable automatic nudge
)

# If give-up detected, nudge_prompt is generated
if "nudge_prompt" in result:
    nudge = result["nudge_prompt"]
    # In production: re-invoke agent with nudge
    # retry_response = agent.invoke(nudge)
```

### Nudge Prompt Templates

Different templates for different give-up signals:

#### NO_DATA_FOUND
```
You claimed no data was found. Please confirm you:
1. Executed the search/query tool with the correct parameters
2. Checked all relevant data sources including archives
3. Used appropriate time ranges and filters
Please retry with a more comprehensive search strategy.

Original request: Find logs for error 500 from last week
```

#### CANNOT_ANSWER
```
You indicated you cannot answer this question. Please confirm you:
1. Have access to all necessary tools and resources
2. Attempted to use available tools to gather information
3. Considered alternative approaches to the problem
Please retry with a different strategy.
```

#### INSUFFICIENT_INFO
```
You claimed insufficient information. Please confirm you:
1. Attempted to gather additional context from available sources
2. Used all available tools to retrieve more information
3. Considered what information is actually required vs. nice-to-have
Please retry with available information.
```

### Context-Specific Enhancements

The nudge includes context from tool telemetry:

```python
# If no tools were called
"Note: It appears no tools were called. Please use available tools to complete the task."

# If some tools were called
"Note: You previously used tools: search_logs, search_db. 
Consider using additional tools or different parameters."

# Always includes original request
"Original request: [user's original prompt]"
```

### Nudge Effectiveness Tracking

Track whether nudges actually help:

```python
# Get nudge statistics
stats = kernel.get_alignment_stats()
nudge_stats = stats["nudge_mechanism"]

print(f"Total Nudges: {nudge_stats['total_nudges']}")
print(f"Successful Nudges: {nudge_stats['successful_nudges']}")
print(f"Success Rate: {nudge_stats['success_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Improvement Rate: {nudge_stats['improvement_rate']:.2%}")
```

### Max Nudges Limit

Prevent infinite nudging loop:

```python
# Only nudge once per agent/task (default)
if kernel.nudge_mechanism.should_nudge(outcome, max_nudges=1):
    nudge_prompt = kernel.nudge_mechanism.generate_nudge(outcome)
```

### Recording Nudge Results

```python
# After re-invoking agent with nudge
nudge_result = kernel.nudge_mechanism.record_nudge_result(
    outcome=original_outcome,
    nudge_prompt=nudge_prompt,
    retry_response=retry_response,
    retry_successful=retry_succeeded
)

# Automatic improvement detection
print(f"Improvement Detected: {nudge_result.improvement_detected}")
```

## 4. Value Delivery Metrics (Competence Focus)

### The Problem: Focus on Safety, Not Quality

**Context from Microsoft/Forrester Research**:

Most Agent Control Planes focus on:
- **Cost & Identity**: Billing policies, consumption limits
- **Safety Policy**: "Did it violate safety policy?"

They focus **less** on:
- **Competence**: "Is the agent delivering value?"
- **Quality**: "Is it giving up too easily?"
- **Value Delivery**: "What's the Give-Up Rate?"

### The Differentiation

This system focuses on **Competence/Quality** (Loop 2) as a differentiator:

**Standard Control Planes (Loop 1 - Safety)**:
- ✓ Did it violate policy?
- ✓ Was the action blocked?
- ✓ Did it stay within budget?

**This System (Loop 2 - Competence)**:
- ✓ Is the agent delivering value?
- ✓ Is it giving up too easily?
- ✓ What's the give-up rate?
- ✓ How competent is this agent?

### Value Delivery Metrics

Track metrics that measure competence:

```python
stats = kernel.get_alignment_stats()
value_delivery = stats["value_delivery"]

print(f"Competence Score: {value_delivery['competence_score']}/100")
print(f"Give-Up Rate: {value_delivery['give_up_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Laziness Detection Rate: {value_delivery['laziness_detection_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Nudge Success Rate: {value_delivery['nudge_success_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Total Audits: {value_delivery['total_audits']}")
print(f"Laziness Caught: {value_delivery['laziness_caught']}")
```

### Competence Score Calculation

The competence score (0-100) rewards value delivery:

```python
competence_score = 100.0

# Penalties for poor performance
- give_up_rate * 30        # Max 30 point penalty
- laziness_rate * 40       # Max 40 point penalty

# Bonuses for improvement
+ nudge_success_rate * 20  # Max 20 point bonus

# Ensure bounds [0, 100]
```

**Examples**:
- **Perfect agent**: 0% give-up, 0% laziness → Score: **100**
- **Lazy agent**: 50% give-up, 80% laziness → Score: **17**
- **Improving agent**: 20% give-up, 30% laziness, 60% nudge success → Score: **70**

### Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | Description | Desired | Focus |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Give-Up Rate** | % of interactions where agent gives up | Lower | Competence |
| **Laziness Detection Rate** | % of audits where teacher finds data agent missed | Lower | Quality |
| **Nudge Success Rate** | % of nudges that result in success | Higher | Efficiency |
| **Competence Score** | Overall quality score (0-100) | Higher | Value Delivery |
